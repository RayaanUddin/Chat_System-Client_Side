# Chat_System-Client_Side (Beta)
A chat system server program, which allows clients to communicate with another.

This is my first public project with java. 
It is a working project, but still in beta.
Feel free to view the code and fork it.
Its UI is very basic however it is functional.

## How to use?
Compile the code and run the program with the server running already, either on your local machine or on an existing server(Note: Make sure to change the ip address and port for both server and client side programs, and forward the port on your server side).

- To send a message to all clients, type `<message>`
- To send a message to a specific client, type `<client id>#<message>`

For changing your name:
- Use the menu bar to change your name (Compatible with Mac OS Menu Bar. Uses Default Menu Bar for Windows and Linux)
